### How to Play: 
* Move right: "right" or "d"

## Project Report
### Reflection
The midsemester jam was an interesting test of my skills thus far, both with Godot and time management. I am getting pretty comfortable with the engine and have a good idea of where to look to find the things I need concerning it, but my time management definitely needs some work. The greatest challenge with this project was my ambitition versus amount of time I both had and wanted to work on the project. I got a decent head start before break, but fell behind as Wednesday rolled around. That being said, I am still proud of what I have created even though I had to cull a little bit of content to come to a finished state. Because of the shorter amount of time and my lack of confidence in the style department, I am still worried about the style guide and if I missed something despite combing through each scene. On that note, each iteration of each project I like to think my formating and hierarchy of folders and files gets cleaner, but the src folder could have used a few folders to make the bundle of scenes less messy.  
One last thing I found challenging in regards to this project was how to handle certain variables in Godot that I needed to hold onto even when switching back and forth through many scenes. After looking for a solution, the only one I could come across in a relatively short amount of time was to use a singleton global variable script to house said variables, but I thought I remembered to try and avoid that if possible.
